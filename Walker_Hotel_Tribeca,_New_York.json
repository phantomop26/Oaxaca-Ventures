Check in was a mess, service throughout our stay was not great, and room keys worked only intermittently. We stayed in one of the larger king rooms and it was still the smallest NYC room I‚Äôve ever stayed in, almost comically so. It‚Äôs not a bad hotel but for the price you can do much better, even in Manhattan.",

      "text": "There were a few surprises with this hotel, both good and bad. First, there‚Äôs a hidden facility fee that wasn‚Äôt clear when I booked‚Äîit‚Äôs calculated daily and is quite a high percentage, so the final price is not what you initially see.\n\nThe rooms are small, which is typical in NYC, but even so, I was surprised by Walker Hotel‚Äôs layout. The interior design isn‚Äôt very functional, with a large single sofa taking up a lot of space. The sofa isn‚Äôt particularly comfortable either, and moving it is a hassle‚Äîthe heavy backrest can easily pinch your fingers. I had a painful experience with it, and what really touched me was my 1.5-year-old trying to ‚Äúscold‚Äù the sofa for hurting me! My heart melted, but be cautious and don‚Äôt let kids play around with it‚Äîit‚Äôs very easy to get injured. The room is so tiny that even turning around is difficult.\n\nUltimately, you‚Äôll probably just stay on the bed, which isn‚Äôt a problem if all you need is a place to sleep. After all, the hotel‚Äôs location is excellent‚Äîperfect for exploring NYC, not staying in the room.\n\nThe hotel isn‚Äôt very stroller-friendly either. The check-in desk is on the basement level, and from the first floor, you have to take the stairs up with your luggage and stroller before heading downstairs again to check in. There‚Äôs a man at the entrance wearing a flashy outfit, but all he does is point you to the stairs and then downstairs‚Äîhe won‚Äôt actually help you with your bags. It‚Äôs just how some New Yorkers are: indifferent and cool.\n\nOn the bright side, the coffee shop on the first floor is quite nice, and I had a pleasant experience there.\n\nOverall, while the staff could be more helpful and the rooms are not the most practical, the location and the caf√© downstairs do add some redeeming qualities. Just be prepared for a bit of inconvenience if you‚Äôre traveling with kids or have a lot of luggage.",

Set up of the bathroom is weird too but not that big of the deal in this. Lights are missing randomly. TV is not working well. Walls are also not soundproof, might lead to sleep difficulties.\n\nStaffs are very welcoming and helpful. I hope you guys can review this issue and improve",

      "text": "ADDITION:\nChecked out of the hotel - no charges mentioned at the desk - come to find out there were facility charges that the checkout didn't let me know about. Called and got the receipt emailed to me but this is hotel admin 101! I shouldn't have needed to call for anything past my stay!\n\nALSO I emailed the hotel to ask what would my next stay would look like (based on their speedy response to my last post) NO RESPONSE.. it's nice and all that you have someone checking Google Reviews to appease unhappy clients, but don't play your customers for fools - if you're going to offer to make something right, then do it.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\nDon‚Äôt know how hotels like this get away with the shoe box sized rooms and the insane cost per night. I‚Äôm a native NYer come back here for work regularly and have stayed at many boutique hotels. This is by far the worst for its cost. The room is a literal closet, Lumpy pillows (seriously?? How hard is that to get right?), even though it‚Äôs small they have made it worse through their design choices. You lose space because of the massive garbage cans (there are two; 1 for recyclables - why aren‚Äôt these smaller where they could fit under the sink? Or beside the toilet?)\nPeople say you pay for location but honestly, if you‚Äôre staying in Manhattan ANYWHERE is close to ANYTHING! There is no need for this small a room. And then the WiFi (!!!) can‚Äôt open a single website on this WiFi. COME ON. Terrible.\n\nOh had to come back to add MOTHS!! There are moths in my room‚Ä¶üôÑüò©ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è\n\nAnother addition. Staff I‚Äôm sure is generally good, I didn‚Äôt have a specifically notable experience except I had a friend coming to meet me and asked to leave a key at the desk which they said they couldn‚Äôt do but said they‚Äôd add him to the reservation and he‚Äôd just need to show ID to get the key but later that evening I got a call from my friend saying I needed to call the front desk because they wouldn‚Äôt give him a key. The person at the front desk said that I needed to add my friend to the reservation and I explained that I had at check in but somehow that wasn‚Äôt done. It‚Äôs not a big deal but that‚Äôs why my staff review isn‚Äôt higher. Other than that folks are friendly. Haven‚Äôt needed them for anything else.",

The bad things, though, while few, are enough of a deal breaker that it will keep me from going back, and it's mainly the height of things. The bed's platform is so high off the ground that it needs a step ( but doesn't have one) and to get up in the middle of the night is tricky. If you want to look out the windows, you have 3 options: climb up onto the bed and walk across it, roll across it, or climb up and try to walk the narrow ledge at the end of the bed, which can pretty much only be done by a gymnast on a balance beam. And to get up in the middle of the night when there are two of you and you are the person on the side by the window is a near-death experience. The second issue is that they positioned the handheld shower so high that even on my tiptoes, I could not reach it! And while I understand why a hotel would not put the room number on their room key (plus it's black so you wouldn't see it anyway), it is tricky when you can't easily remember your room number!\nThe hotel itself is beautifully appointed yet comfortable, not pretentious. EVERY SINGLE STAFF PERSON WAS NICE! They were all friendly and kind. There are multiple public spaces within the hotel:  a seating area near the cafe, an on-site restaurant, a lower area lounge by re reception area, and a beautiful  rooftop bar/cafe with amazing views. The hotel is near multiple subway lines and Canal Street, and is right around the corner from the Banksy Museum, as well as within walking distance of both Chinatown and Little Italy. I'd say if you have gymnastic skills to get onto the bed safely, then this hotel is for you.",

I tried to contact the hotel via email to resolve the issue, but I received no response. The lack of communication and transparency was frustrating and unprofessional.\n\nSecondly, the overall service during our stay was subpar. The staff seemed disinterested and were not helpful when we needed assistance. This level of service is unacceptable, especially given the additional charges we incurred.\n\nIn summary, while the Walker Hotel in Tribeca has potential, the poor communication and service we experienced overshadowed the positive aspects of our stay.

Lots of different breakfast, lunch and dinner options within walking distance.\n\nThe hotel appears very modern and luxurious. Downside is that the entrance from the street does not accommodate large suitcases, since you immediately stumble upon stairs. Reception of the hotel is also on the Lower Level. Check in was quick and without any hassle. Note that $500 deposit is required (via creditcard).\n\nThe rooms are not big, but we stayed here for five nights and had enough room to store everything. It's a modern room with a lot of smart buttons for the lighting and blinds. Air Conditioning is also very good, just as the smart tv. Casting your phone actually worked in our room. WiFi is also pretty fine! We do missed a mini fridge and our safe did not work. Even after asking the reception twice to fix it. There were even more minor observations that made me decide to give the review four stars instead of five. The bedframe (or how you can describe it), was broken and made noise when moving. One shelf in the closet had also fallen down and nobody seemed to have fixed it.\n\nAltogether we were happy to have chosen this hotel as the bed was comfortable and the location of the hotel was great.",

The night prior to arriving in NYC, I called to see if we could have access to one room to drop our luggage and freshen up from the flights. The person over the phone said just to show up and there will be an option available. I would've preferred some assurance, or a plan to avoid the convo again when checking in. When we arrived, sure enough I had to give the whole spiel, and was told that they didn't say that, and they meant I could store them in a closet. I've been to many hotels and understand what's available and how it works. Anyways, we got a room after my lecture. The room had a pubic hair on the pillow, a large dip in the ground upon entry, the door threshold cracked had to SLAM the door to close it, toothpaste or something on the bathroom light switch. Just not comfortable and not what a room should be like. I figured I would just accept it and after the AC not working that night, knew I couldn't spend more nights there. The night desk agent was helpful and switched my room, and when going into that one, there was another pubic hair and stains on the vanity counter, in addition to the issues of leaking showers. There are definitely structural issues and water issues happening in these rooms.\n\nOne night, I was walking to show my sister Saint Tuesday. The young male host attendant  spoke to me so nasty and sarcastic, I was embarrassed and angry about it. I chose to accept it, but now wish I would have given it back to him. Completely unprofessional, rude, and uncalled for. I think he forgot who the host was and who the guest was. When I told the same night agent, she apologized and offered a late check out. Why the hell would I want to stay in this place longer? Not an acceptable resolution. Very disappointed and will never stay again, despite many trips each year to the city. The pictures definitely paint a different experience.",

Shower was so tiny, good luck if you‚Äôre over 6 feet, or if you‚Äôre heavier than the average person. A lot of bumping into things! Bumping into the bed, bumping into the sink, bumping into the toilet,etc. Just way too tiny for $250/night. Not a reasonable price. Also tacked on some fees. For one single night they held $450 on my credit card. That included the $125/day refundable fee. The staff were great, the hotel was clean.

The shared space is nice looking. l have no idea if it is filled with hotel guests or blue bottle customers. There is no drinks service in the lobby and both the roof bar and restaurant bar are closed several days a week. The whole place feels like some rooms above a whole bunch of leased spaces for other businesses.\n\nBiggest issues for me is there is no one to greet you at the entrance, the ‚Äúlobby‚Äù is in a sub-basement. Getting in or out of a car with packages is a juggle on a busy street up and down several flights of stairs with no help.\n\nThe service is seriously disappointing. Its earnest but utterly hapless, I get the feel that most people have never worked in hospitality before. They have no idea what to say or do when confronted with something as simple as a package delivery or pickup- this is not a business hotel at all.\n\nThe base rooms are very tiny, I was staying in the corner which is somewhat more spacious. But the surfaces are seriously worn- cigarette holes in upholstery, very visible peeling paint etc.\n\nIf you are looking for prime location and a place to sleep this might be a good fit, if you are looking for a ‚Äúhotel‚Äù with a modicum of service and pleasure look elsewhere.",

I booked directly via the hotel website which offered breakfast and 2pm checkout as part of the room rate. The breakfast is a coffee and non-savoury pastry from their Uruguayan restaurant - which was delicious for lunch. The late check out caused a little hassle because my room key wasn‚Äôt working when I returned around 1:30pm to get my luggage and I had to wait for someone to let me in with a managers key. Someone also called me at 1pm to remind me I needed to check out, so I think their systems haven‚Äôt noted which rooms are late check outs. If there is a way to get luggage in and out of the building without having to navigate some stairs I never found it. But I appreciated the clean design and perks and would stay again.",

Although the staff did their best to accommodate, this was an uncomfortable experience that only allowed so much for rest. I first had to switch rooms due to features that needed updating or care. Secondly, when I did switch rooms there was a heavy odor of marijuana and an eventual alarm that persisted for much of the rest of my stay. Please see below for additional details on what I encountered during my stay. Again, while the staff was kind the night of my arrival and during the day, this seems to be issues that need better management for optimal guest experiences. Unfortunately, I'm not sure that Walker Hotels will be a first choice for me again.",

It‚Äôs pretty much a high end hostel (especially if you get the smallest room). The room is super small but has everything you need. The view is incredible and the mattress was so comfortable. The pillows could have been firmer. The shower was good too. Overall an excellent decision and I loved it. The area can get a bit sketchy at night so though during the day it was easy to use the subway at night I ended up Ubering back to the hotel. And the location is great but far from a lot of areas.\n\nMy only point with the hotel is the staff though very friendly and kind were not always knowing what to do. I asked multiple times if I can pay in cash and was told once I check out it won‚Äôt be a problem. I come to check out and they had already charged my card. I ended up having to wait 20 mins for them to figure it out. That‚Äôs one example of a few things that happened. Obviously won‚Äôt keep me from staying again but it could have been more seamless with a more professional staff.\n\nOtherwise, really enjoyed and will stay again! I love also stayed at Greenwich and I think I liked this one better (though Greenwich was great as well). Definitely recommend!",

Its a struggle to fit two people in even the largest of rooms with luggage. Hardly any closet space and the bathroom is tricky.\n\nSecondly, the staff at this establishment are despicable, bar one guy, who is Jamaican, who helps with luggage. He was the only friendly and respectful person employed by this hotel and offered suggestions on what to do in the blistering heat, which was more local than the tourist hot spots. The cleaning in our room was not substantial as they found earrings that didn't belong to me and left them on the counter even though they were covered in junk/dust.\n\nThirdly, which brings me to the most heinous point of all. I had a sentimental plushy which was given to me by my partner when we first met 8 years ago. The cleaners somehow took this from our room, and presumably got caught up with the sheets. When we reported it to the reception they told us we were lying because 'why would a cleaner want that' and said we must have misplaced it because the cleaners said they left it in our room. We were in no way accusing them of theft but explained to this incredibly rude woman on reception that we suspected it was caught up. She denied they had it explicitly and was not helpful. We checked in for the rest of our trip to see if it had shown up but were met with the same attitude. We left our details, so if they did indeed find it, it could be returned to us ASAP as, stated above, it holds extreme sentimental value.\n\nA few days after we left, my partner did in fact receive an email from Mercedes, saying they unsurprisingly had found the plushy. There was no apology, and no time frame stated as to when this needed to be collected. As myself and my partner do not live in the US, we enlisted the help of a friend to collect but they weren't able immediately as were working in LA. My partner called to check a couple of weeks ago about when this could be sent to us as we realized it may take too long only to find that the hotel had thrown it away. We received no communications from them stating that it needed to be collected before x date. They just decided that they would throw something away we specifically had asked them to find. THAT THEY HAD TAKEN FROM US IN THE FIRST PLACE.\n\nThis hotel ruined my birthday and has lost something that to me was priceless. I implore people to never stay here as they clearly do not value their customers and are literally some of the worst service staff I have ever encountered.",

I told the very nice front desk person that the closest I'd ever been to the hotel is to use the bathroom at Blue Bottle in the lobby one time.\n\nWe went up to the roof, which has a grand view of the city and hideous decor at the bar. There was a drink list, but I guess you had to ask for a menu. It seemed like the only food anyone could order is a mezze plate where everything appeared to be from Key Foods and served on what I think are those awful disposable bamboo plates.\n\nThe drink list was appalling. One red and one white wine. Four or five underwhelming IPAs and a lager. Four sickly house cocktails and three treacly frozen drinks. A liquor menu that resembles the options available on a Jet Blue flight.\n\nEverything was overpriced, but nothing seemed as insultingly expensive as I had guessed. We ordered two simple well drinks, listed at $14. The bartender gave us a bill for $36‚Äîone for $20, the other for $16, which she says is the cost of adding mixers like sugar and lemon juice.\n\nSome companions showed up and left immediately. I wished we'd done the same. We watched an enormous TV flicker through someone's window three blocks away. We looked at the skyline and tried to see my office. We looked at the Renzo Piano Jenga tower and the other famous buildings. Of course we couldn't see our neighborhood in Queens from there, where our local dive objectively surpasses this con job in every metric. Who goes here, I don't know. It's probably the same kind of person who makes a reservation at like a Chili's in Times Square while they're visiting the city to shop at Bergdorf and take selfies at Trump Tower. They're probably getting cancer from bowel insertions of a platinum AmEx and are probably over-leveraged. When I go running in the morning, in an attempt to outlive these cretins, I am in a citywide cloud of smog, caused in part by their Ubers and the Ubers of people like them.\n\nI feel sorry for them, but they also brought this on themselves while they ruin everything for everyone else.",

For those of you traveling with a companion, the bathroom door loosely slides closed and doesn‚Äôt latch. There is no fan. You can hear EVERYTHING your traveling companion is doing in there. No refrigerator, no coffee, no iron. The quality of the rooms was mixed. Bedding was very comfortable and the plumbing fixtures were high quality. The shade for the window in the room only operates on an automatic button. Ours did not function upon arrival. Maintenance was able to fix it promptly. Service was polite, but not quite what I was expecting. We ordered champagne when we booked the room and they forgot to deliver it on the first night. When I asked about it the second night, they apologized and sent us up a bottle. However, I was just handed a bottle of warm champagne. Not even a bucket of ice with it. Overall, it was fine, but I‚Äôd consider another property on my next visit to the city.",

Disregard the comments about the size of the room. The room is a cozy size, there are compartments for all your luggage/bags, it is tech-savvy, and the beds are extremely comfortable. The staff always made sure my stay was going well and that we had water in the room.\n\nThe lobby and main seating area are exceptionally beautiful. They did an amazing job on their interior design. I had the opportunity to speak to a lady who is part of the marketing and interior design team. We had a lovely talk about the design that went into making the hotel. The seating area on the 2nd floor is a great spot to unwind and have a cocktail or coffee during your stay.\n\nChoose this hotel instead of the other chain hotels in NY. The experience and customer service that you will receive here is top notch. Thank you to the staff of Walker Hotel for a superb first visit to NY!",

Once given the key to our room, we opened the door to find an unclean room with towels stacked on the bathroom floor, a dirty shower, no soap, a full garbage and a messy bed. We were celebrating a special occasion and this room was expensive so this was shocking to see. We first called down to the front desk about this situation and no one answered. Then, we went to the front desk and explained the situation. Then, we were given a key to a different room. This next room was much smaller than the original room. So now, we were even more upset. We proceed to go back down to the front desk and explain that the new room was not what we expected or paid for and they said that there was nothing else available and we‚Äôd have to check in later (with no guarantee) for another room. We then asked if they could muster an apology for this situation as we explained that this was very unprofessional of the hotel. To which the front desk responded, ‚Äúit is not unprofessional, it is human error.‚Äù The tone of the front desk and the complete lack of empathy was very unsettling. We ended up staying in the second room as we didn‚Äôt want to deal with the front desk anymore. Aside from this, the rooms (both that we saw) were tiny and the staff are not customer service oriented. We would not come back.",

He really put me at ease throughout our communications in a way that made me feel great about re-booking a stay at this hotel.

I looked at a lot of reviews and honestly, was not super sure due to various good and below average reviews, but I only had the best experience with the staff, room, cleanliness, etc. The bookings are clear on how big they are - 190SF for the Cortland Corner King I booked. That is small, yes, but it is NYC, and also not too small at all. Again, they tell you this in the booking, so no surprises. The 3 windows in the corner room make it feel bigger too, so I recommend booking a Cortland Corner King room (the description in booking also clarified 3 windows, as opposed to 1). Shower was incredible - hot water and great pressure. I was on the 4th floor (of 10) but the view was still nice of the buildings around me. I am sure a higher floor would be even better. Only comments on the room for improvement is that the outside glass of the windows were filthy, so it blocked some of the view / not good for taking a photo of the window views, and then there is really no place to hang towels by the sink - would be easy to add those to the rooms so there is a place to set wet / drying towels (there is 1 hook in the bathroom right next to the toilet - not an ideal hygienic place to set a hand or face towel). Lastly, no mini fridge for food leftovers, drinks, etc. That is a nice feature when traveling alone and not being able to finish a meal, but wanting to save for later.\n\nThe staff was very friendly and I interreacted with at least 5 different people between the desk staff and the bellhops / doormen throughout my stay (no issues - just check in, random questions, and holding my baggage).\n\nBlue Bottle in their lobby is a great amenity. I had coffee there all three days, and worked from there prior to my check in after I landed. Many options for sitting / lounging / working. I was there the last day the rooftop bar (Honey Be?) was open for the season, and this is the only part of the hotel where the staff was not super friendly. The male bartender was great, but there was a female bartender who was simply not enjoying being there and did not care to offer any type of friendly service. No bother, I got two yummy (but overpriced) drinks and beautiful views of the city, so not a huge bummer. Lastly, the small bar below the hotel was incredible - I went 2 nights in a row, and two different bands were playing wonderful live instrumental music (jazz both times). Again, the drinks are pricey, but they also offer beer and wine at a bit lower of a price point if wanting to just hang there and listen to music without spending way too much. open until 2am as well.\n\nOverall, I loved my stay here, and would 10/10 book again in a Cortland Corner King.",

The hotel itself was very nice & trendy as were the rooms.\n\nI know people have complained how small the rooms are but honestly for a solo traveler spending little time in the room it was perfect and everything was well thought out! I think much of the problem is people don't understand the size perhaps in comparison to their own rooms/other hotels. On the official Walker Hotel website not only do they give the square footage but they show a room floorplan and photos. I booked on Hotels.com and they did not give as much info so maybe it's third party websites not disclosing as much info that's leading to some surprises when people see the size of the rooms.\n\nOne qualm was that the Chromecast did not work. I tried multiple times and separately with my phone and iPad - nothing worked. Additionally, as others had mentioned no mini fridge and water only upon request. Also my room had a view right into a fabric/furniture factory (?) so I couldn't keep my shade open much but this might just be reality on lower floors of a hotel in a big city.",

The gym was ok - I'm not sure whether I liked the tredmill equivalent equipment, but it was different! The one major drawback to my experience was how THIN the WALLS were. I could hear EVERYTHING from my neighbors activities next door, and it was disturbing. I called the hotel, and they offered to do a floor check.

The hotel is well located, its so close to Canal Street, Metro stations, Broadway, Little Italy and Chinatown. I loved the blue bottle coffee shop which is behind the hotels lobby area (the serve good coffee, better than the one from the lobby bar). There is a Gym, but I didnt use it.\nThere were cleaning issues with our room and the room we had was extremely small. My boyfriend informed the management, they took care and offered a solution. At the end we were really happy with the larger room and the better cleaning. What I liked about the rooms was the king bed and big TV. Also no need to insert any cards to get electricity (I hate that in other hotels). There was not enough light to do make up (bring your own mirror and use daylight). The view was not spectacular, but for us a cozy bed with TV and cleanliness were more important. Bathroom was ok. Little people might need help to get the shower head üòÇ The reception was also extremely helpful regarding restaurants recommendations and reservation calls (@Steven, we tried Boqueria the other day and were rolling home that night! So yummy!). Go and talk to the reception staff, they are so nice, funny and helpful.\nWe really enjoyed our stay over Christmas and NYE and will consider coming back to Walker ‚ù§Ô∏è",

My husband and I asked the concierge to contact the Police Department to break up the brawl but he stated that because it was off premises there was nothing he could do . He simply stood by and watched the crowd fight I had to call the Police. The entire ordeal was not handled properly and a supervisor should definitely investigate this matter for training purposes on how to handle these situations in the future if they should ever occur again. A refund would have been appreciated since I was unable to sleep nor enjoyed my stay",

Sensed his pride in the Walker and the transformation into a boutique Hotel.\nTraveled up the elevator to my room, appreciating the security measure of needing a key to get to your specific floor.  A clean narrow hall in muted tones guided me to my suite for the evening.\nI looooovvved my room, which was a Walker Full!  Incredibly good use of space for its size.  Have a look at the photo's on site.  They represent the room well and are not manufactured.

The shower was absolutely magical (we spent quite some time analysing why; we agreed it was a combination of the perfect temperature and the softness of the water). The hotel is so modern and luxurious, very well designed with a high level of focus on details. Would advise to book for people who are comfortable to be naked around each other: the shower screen is see through and the bathroom door (where the toilet is) doesn't really close 100% so could be a little too personal for some guests. The staff was super friendly and very welcoming. We would love to visit again!",

First of all, the hotel front desk is located in the -1 floor which means Guests are not able to see the the staff when arriving at the hotel, so do not expect any personal service. When we arrived at the room, there were dirty spots at the bed and the shower was sinking. We reported to the concierge and do not receive any feedback about the problems during our stay. The worst thing that happened is that our door was left OPEN by the cleaning staff and we found out when we arrived at the hotel 11 PM. Our room door was left open for the entire day. I am extremely disappointed with the service of the hotel and would recommend to look into other options instead of this one.",

The A/C in the first room wasn‚Äôt working when I checked in - no big deal I just called down to ask for someone to take a look while I grabbed a bite to eat. I come back and it‚Äôs still not working. I call down to the front desk and the receptionist says they can‚Äôt move me because they are all ‚Äúbooked up‚Äù even though they had rooms available online. Eventually the manger Matt calls me and says ‚Äúyou‚Äôre correct sir it seems you‚Äôre having a HVAC issue‚Äù - you don‚Äôt say Matt. He offers to move me to a new smaller room for the same price. I was being very polite while Matt was being rude and condescending while we were making the switch. I begrudgingly took the smaller room so that I wouldn‚Äôt have to spend my night looking for a new hotel. Low and behold the A/C is not working there either. I asked Matt if the whole building was having issues and he responded ‚Äúnope just the rooms we are putting you in‚Äù. He offered no resolution almost expecting me to leave at this point.That was the last straw as I did not feel welcome here at all. No one apologized once and Matt had zero empathy for the fact that I would now have to try and find a new hotel at 9 o clock at night in a new City due to their lack of customer service. Ended up staying at Moxy in East Village, it was amazing! Do not recommend giving Walker your business mostly because of the manager there Matt.",

      "text": "Good:\n\nThe hotel was brand new (opened Sep 2019) - electronic curtains, USB by the bed.\nThe staff was extremely helpful and friendly. From changes during our stay, to recommendations around, sent mail on my behalf and were constantly smiling and friendly.\nWe really liked the location (except one thing as listed below) - walking distance from Soho, very close to the subway. 7-eleven right on the corner of the street, a few restaurants close by. Not very touristic which was a big plus for us.\nThe price we paid was definitely good value for money.\n\nBad:\n\nThe rooms are very, extremely small. I've stayed at Manhattan hotels in the past and I expected a small space but this was something else. Very well thought of in terms of smart space usage but for a couple on a week long vacation to NY, with plenty of luggage, that was extremely uncomfortable. The hotel did switch us to a bigger room when we asked, but even the bigger room was significantly smaller then we're accustomed to.\nThe room was very poorly isolated. We could hear EVERYTHING that happened around us. Both from the street and from other rooms. We're not light sleepers but still we had a trouble sleeping, especially after 7am as there wasn't good light cover and the room got a lot of sunlight even with curtains on. We basically couldn't sleep past 7am or 8am tops. An afternoon nap (we tried) was completely impossible, because of above reasons but also house cleaning cleaned rooms with the door open around us very noisily.\nThe location was great (very close to subway, soho, far from most touristic areas) BUT very close to the hotel, on the way from the subway there was a corner with 3-10 homeless people. It was very uncomfortable passing through them every night. Sometimes we prefered to stay in as my wife was uncomfortable to come back late at night because of them.\nSome additional not critical but \"constructive\" feedback:\n- Some functionality in the room wasn't well installed - the toilet flushing cover was broken (we complained but wasn't fixed) so it fell off every time we flushed\n- It was very difficult to set the level of the electric curtains. Either completely up or completely down.\n- Our room wasn't cleaned every day. On our 3rd night we had to ask the front desk specifically to clean the room and get us more TP as it wasn't cleaned since we checked in. Same thing on our 6th night.",

She always was very knowledgeable about current events and how those said events are effecting her place of employment/business. This isn't the greatest neighborhood, during the day there was homeless people abound all around the area in literally every single direction and Just Around the corner there seems to be an alleyway where homeless tend to congrigate, inject drugs, openly use the bathroom and dedicate literally out in the street. But other then that, the actual inside of this place is quiet fancy, I recently had a room on the 5th floor and I felt as though is was literally the best bargain price I've ever paid for a hotel room In my entire life and that it was an extremely well maintained and groomed room especially for the price",

The cafe and lobby bar are so convenient, as well as the nearby subway hub on canal street. I was surprised to hear the rooftop bar is also open until 2am (though it closed early on us due to weather). Pro Tip: the stairwell to the roof is unlocked! Location is great right at the corner of Chinatown, Little Italy, SoHo and Tribeca. Although rooms are small and cleaning could be improved, they work well and have lots of hidden storage. All in all, I highly recommend staying at Walker Hotel!!",

I had a bit of a transcendent experience but I'll try my best to describe my stay.\n\nLocation:\nNestled between Chinatown and Tribeca, with SoHo's shops a brief jaunt up Broadway, the only problem with the hotel's location is figuring out which of the many sights, sounds, tastes, and feels you want to explore first. Canal St. Station is right around the corner for excursions outside the immediate area. You hungry? Feast your eyes and ears on a cacophony of halal carts and myriad cafes offering priced sustenance (who is to say what is over or under?).\n\nAmbience:\nThe air conditioning was cool, especially during NYC's sweltering summer humid swamp season--but the lobby is even cooler. Reception is in the lower floor, a Blue Bottle cafe affixed to a decidedly modern-chic first floor. When you start feeling a bit claustrophobic from working out of your admittedly cozy suite, make your way down to the cafe and feel free to conduct your all day on-site interviews there (don't forget your noise canceling headphones!). The aesthetic was perfect for what I was looking for, and I wasn't even looking for anything in particular. It just felt right.\n\nAmenities:\nI could drone on and on about \"amenities\" like the awesome picturesque 12th floor rooftop bar, or the luxurious food and drink in the first floor barestaraunt, or the **redacted** (you'll have to make friends in order to find out what awesome amenity this is referring to). But ultimately, it's the people that made this an essential part of my NYC city experience. In my unplanned extended residence at Walker Tribeca, the staff really made me feel right at home. No exaggeration. From Luis, to Lisa, Cory, Chris, Chris, Joe, and a few others I've undoubtedly missed, they treated me both as a welcome guest and dear friend. Several nights I convinced myself to call an audible because the drinks and conversation were so engrossing at the Hotel bars\n\nIn summary, if you are looking for a centrally-located base of operations to take on NYC, you would be hard-pressed to find an experience quite like Walker Tribeca. Thank you again to the whole staff for an unforgettable stay.",

      "text": "I checked in at the Walker Hotel Tribeca on Friday 10/01 and was planning on staying for a week. On Mon 10/04, I started getting bites on my ankles. Tuesday 10/05 I started to feel raised bumps on my arm and on Wed the bites were painful and itchy. I asked for a new room and got placed in a new room. At this point I was hoping they were hives or an allergic reaction. I submitted pictures to a dermatologist through the teladoc service through my insurance and she responded right away that the bites were most likely bed bug bites. I learned that bed bugs bite in a line called \"breakfast, lunch, dinner\" configuration (you can see this along my elbow in the attached pictures). I immediately notified the front desk and checked out of the hotel. I was supposed to stay at friends' places for the rest of my stay but couldn't risk bringing bed bugs to their homes so had to buy a new flight home earlier than expected.\n\nThe hotel said that in order for me to get a refund they were having an inspection done of the room.  They would refund me if they found bed bugs but if they didn't, i would still have to pay the full amount. They called me the next day and said they didn't find evidence of bed bugs and they offered a discount on my next stay. I understand that they have to protect themself from saying they are at fault; however, given that I incurred the costs of medical appt, medication, new flight, new hotel, cleaning supplies, laundromat, dry cleaning, new luggage, plus cutting my trip short it is very, very painful for me that I still have to give them >$1,000.\n\nSome things I've learned:\n1. Even seemingly nice hotels can have bed bugs\n2. Always do your own check. When I left the room, I was really hoping they were hives so didn't check myself. I'm also going to do a thorough check every time i get to a new hotel.\n3. Don't get too upset about things that you can't control.\n\nEdit: adding photo a few days later. Bites still painful and itchy",
